# Firebase Security Rules & Indexes Documentation
## Focus Flow Timer - Enterprise Edition

### üìã Overview
This document provides comprehensive documentation for the Firebase Security Rules and Indexes implementation for the Focus Flow Timer application. The security model has been designed to support enterprise-grade security, scalability, and performance.

### üîê Security Architecture

#### User Roles & Permissions
The system supports the following user roles with different access levels:

**Standard User (Default)**
- Access to own data only (tasks, sessions, analytics)
- Read access to global configurations
- Read access to leaderboards
- Cannot access premium features

**Premium User**
- All standard user permissions
- Access to AI insights and advanced analytics
- Enhanced export capabilities
- Priority customer support features

**Enterprise User**
- All premium user permissions
- Organization and workspace access
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced reporting and admin tools

**Admin**
- Full system access
- User management capabilities
- Global configuration management
- Access to audit logs and security events

**System User (Backend Services)**
- Automated system operations
- Data processing and aggregation
- Background task execution
- System maintenance operations

#### Security Principles

1. **User Isolation**: Every user can only access their own data
2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Features and data access based on user roles
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security validation
4. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users get minimum necessary permissions
5. **Audit Trail**: All operations are logged for security monitoring

### üóÇÔ∏è Collection Security Matrix

| Collection | Read Access | Write Access | Special Notes |
|------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| `tasks` | Owner + Admin | Owner only | User isolation enforced |
| `enhanced_tasks` | Owner + Admin | Owner only | Extended task features |
| `sessions` | Owner + Admin | Owner only | Timer session data |
| `timer_sessions` | Owner + Admin | Owner only | Timer-specific sessions |
| `pomodoro_sessions` | Owner + Admin | Owner only | Pomodoro-specific sessions |
| `daily_stats` | Owner + Admin | Owner only | Daily analytics |
| `stats` | Owner + Admin | Owner only | General statistics |
| `task_analytics` | Owner + Admin | Owner only | Task-specific metrics |
| `session_analytics` | Owner + Admin | Owner only | Session analytics |
| `users/{userId}` | Owner + Admin | Owner only | User profiles |
| `goals` | Owner + Admin | Owner only | User goals |
| `user_achievements` | Owner + Admin | Owner only | Achievement tracking |
| `user_productivity_scores` | Owner + Admin | Owner only | Productivity metrics |

| `ai_insights` | Owner + Premium | Admin + System | AI-powered insights |
| `advanced_analytics` | Owner + Premium | Admin + System | Premium analytics |
| `organizations` | Members only | Admins only | Enterprise orgs |
| `workspaces` | Members only | Admins only | Team workspaces |
| `global` | All authenticated | Admin only | Global config |
| `ml_models` | All authenticated | Admin only | AI models |
| `audit_logs` | Admin only | Admin + System | Security auditing |
| `export_requests` | Owner only | Owner create, System update | Data exports |
| `user_quotas` | Owner only | Admin + System | Rate limiting |

### üéØ Index Strategy

#### Core Principles
1. **User-First Indexing**: All user queries include userId as the first field
2. **Query Pattern Optimization**: Indexes match common query patterns
3. **Sorting Optimization**: Proper ordering for pagination and filtering
4. **Array Field Support**: Efficient array-contains queries for tags and roles
5. **Range Query Support**: Time-based and numeric range queries

#### Key Index Categories

**Task Management Indexes**
- User tasks by completion status and creation date
- Task filtering by category, priority, and due dates
- Project and assignment-based queries
- Tag-based task discovery

**Session Analytics Indexes**
- User sessions by time periods
- Session type and completion status filtering
- Task-linked session queries
- Performance metric aggregations

**Leaderboard Indexes**
- Score-based rankings with activity recency
- Multiple leaderboard types (productivity, focus time, streaks)
- User position lookups
- Achievement-based filtering

**Enterprise Indexes**
- Organization member queries
- Workspace task sharing
- Team productivity metrics
- Multi-tenant data isolation

**Time-Series Indexes**
- Daily, weekly, monthly analytics
- Trend analysis queries
- Historical data retrieval
- Performance monitoring

### üöÄ Performance Optimizations

#### Query Efficiency
1. **Compound Indexes**: Multi-field indexes for complex queries
2. **Field Order Optimization**: Equality filters before range filters
3. **Collection Group Queries**: Efficient cross-collection searches
4. **Array Field Optimization**: Proper array-contains indexing

#### Scalability Features
1. **User Sharding**: Natural sharding by userId
2. **Time-Based Partitioning**: Date-based collection organization
3. **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk operations support
4. **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connections

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Validations

#### Data Validation Functions
```javascript
// User ownership validation
function isOwner(userId) {
  return isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
}

// Role-based access validation
function hasRole(role) {
  return isAuthenticated() && 
         request.auth.token != null && 
         request.auth.token.get(role, false) == true;
}

// Data structure validation
function isValidTaskData() {
  let data = request.resource.data;
  return data.keys().hasAll(['title', 'createdAt', 'userId']) &&
         data.title is string && 
         data.title.size() > 0 &&
         data.userId == request.auth.uid;
}
```

#### Security Features
1. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive data validation
2. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries
3. **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization
4. **CSRF Protection**: Token-based validation
5. **Rate Limiting**: Request throttling and quotas

### üìä Monitoring & Auditing

#### Audit Trail
All operations are logged with:
- User identification
- Action performed
- Resource accessed
- Timestamp
- IP address and user agent
- Success/failure status

#### Security Events
Critical security events trigger alerts:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Data export requests
- Admin privilege usage
- Suspicious query patterns

#### Performance Monitoring
Key metrics tracked:
- Query execution times
- Index utilization rates
- Document read/write counts
- Error rates and types
- User activity patterns
