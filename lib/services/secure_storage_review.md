# Security Review: Token Storage Analysis

## Review Date: August 28, 2025

## Overview
This document confirms the security review of data storage practices in the Focus Flow Timer application.

## Findings

### SharedPreferences Usage ✅ SECURE
After comprehensive code review, SharedPreferences is only used for:
- Theme preferences (`theme_mode`)
- Timer settings (durations, sound preferences)
- User preferences and app configuration
- Cached analytics data and offline data
- Non-sensitive application state

**No sensitive tokens, credentials, or authentication data is stored in SharedPreferences.**

### Firebase Authentication 🔐 SECURE
- Firebase Auth handles all authentication tokens internally
- No manual token storage or management detected
- Firebase SDK handles secure token management automatically

### API Keys 🔐 PROPERLY CONFIGURED
- Firebase API keys are properly configured in `firebase_options.dart`
- HuggingFace API key (if used) is passed as parameter, not stored locally
- No hardcoded sensitive credentials found

## Conclusion
The application follows secure storage practices:
- ✅ SharedPreferences used only for non-sensitive data
- ✅ Firebase Auth handles sensitive authentication securely
- ✅ No credentials stored insecurely
- ✅ No additional secure storage implementation needed

## Recommendation
Current storage implementation is secure and compliant with best practices. No changes required for Google Play Store compliance.
