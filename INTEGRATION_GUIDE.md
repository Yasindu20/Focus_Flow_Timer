## 🎮 How to Use the New Features

### **1. Enable Focus Mode:**
```dart
// In your app, navigate to Focus Settings
// Toggle "Enable Focus Mode" 
// Configure blocking level (Gentle/Moderate/Strict)
// Select ambient sound profile
```

### **2. Start Enhanced Focus Session:**
```dart
final timerProvider = Provider.of<EnhancedTimerProvider>(context);

// When user clicks "Start Session", the following happens automatically:
await timerProvider.startTimer(
  type: TimerType.pomodoro,
  taskId: selectedTaskId,
);

// This triggers:
// - Notification blocking (if enabled)
// - App blocking system activation
// - Ambient audio starts playing
// - Analytics session tracking begins
// - XP tracking starts
```

### **3. Monitor Focus Progress:**
```dart
// Access real-time focus data
final analytics = FocusAnalyticsService();
final insights = await analytics.getInsights();

// Check gamification progress
final gamification = FocusGamificationService();
final level = gamification.level;
final xp = gamification.experience;
final badges = gamification.earnedBadges;
```

## 🔧 Integration Steps for Your Existing App

### **Step 1: Update Main App**
Add focus dashboard to your main timer screen:

```dart
// In your main timer screen widget
import '../widgets/focus_dashboard_widget.dart';

// Add below your existing timer widget
const FocusDashboardWidget(),
```

### **Step 2: Add Navigation**
Add focus screens to your app navigation:

```dart
// In your route definitions
'/focus-settings': (context) => const FocusSettingsScreen(),
'/focus-analytics': (context) => const FocusAnalyticsScreen(),
```

### **Step 3: Initialize Services**
Ensure services are initialized in your app startup:

```dart
// In your main.dart or app initialization
final timerProvider = EnhancedTimerProvider();
await timerProvider.initialize(); // This initializes all focus services
```
